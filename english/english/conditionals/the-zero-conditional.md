# The Zero Conditional

#### Descritpion

This conditional is used when the result will always happen. So, if water reaches 100 degrees, it always boils. It's a fact. I'm talking in general, not about one particular situation. The result of the 'if clause' is always the main clause.

The 'if' in this conditional can usually be replaced by 'when' without changing the meaning.

We can make a zero conditional sentence with two present simple _**\(insert link to present simple when exist\)**_ verbs \(one in the 'if clause' and one in the 'main clause'\):

* If + present simple, .... present simple.



#### Example

* If water **reaches** 100 degrees, it **boils**. \(It is always true, there can't be a different result sometimes\).
*  If I **eat** peanuts, I **am** sick. \(This is true only for me, maybe, not for everyone, but it's still true that I'm sick every time I eat peanuts\)
