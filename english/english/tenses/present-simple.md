# Present Simple

#### Descritpion

The simple present tense is one of several forms of present tense in English. It is used to describe **habits, unchanging situations, general truths, and fixed arrangements**. The simple present tense is simple to form. Just use the base form of the verb: \(I take, you take, we take, they take\) The 3rd person singular takes an -s at the end. \(he takes, she takes\). 

We use the present simple to talk about:

* something that is **true** in the present:

> _I**'m** nineteen years old.  
> I**'m** a student.  
> He **lives** in London._

* something that **happens regularly** in the present:

> _I **play** football every weekend._

* something that is always true:

> _The human body **contains** 206 bones.  
> Light **travels** at almost 300,000 kilometres per second._

We also use the present simple to talk about:

* something that is **fixed** in the future:

> _The school term **starts** next week.  
> The train **leaves** at 19.45 this evening.  
> We **fly** to Paris next week._

* something in the future **after time words** like _when_, _after_ and _before_ and **after** _if_ and _unless_:

> _I'll talk to John **when** I **see** him.  
> You must finish your work **before** you **go** home._  
> _**If** it **rains** we'll get wet.  
> He won't come **unless** you **ask** him_

We sometimes use the present simple to talk about the past when we are: 

* telling a story:

> _I was walking down the street the other day when suddenly this man **comes up** to me and **tells** me he **has lost** his wallet and **asks** me to lend him some money. Well, he **looks** a bit dangerous so I**'m** not sure what to do and while we **are standing there** …_

* summarising a book, film or play:

> _Harry Potter **goes** to Hogwarts School. He **has** two close friends, Hermione and …_
>
> _Shakespeare's Hamlet **is** the Prince of Denmark. One night he **sees** his father's ghost. The ghost **tells him** he **has been murdered** …_
