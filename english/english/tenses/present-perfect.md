# Present Perfect

The **present perfect** is formed from the present tense of the verb _**have**_ and the past participle ****of a verb.

We use the present perfect:

* for something that **started in the past** and **continues in the present**:

> _They**'ve been married** for nearly fifty years.  
> She **has lived** in Liverpool all her life._

* when we are talking about our **experience up to the present**:

> _I**'ve seen** that film before.  
> I**'ve played** the guitar ever since I was a teenager.  
> He **has written** three books and he is working on another one._

We often use the adverb _**ever**_ to talk about experience up to the present:

> _My last birthday was the worst day I **have ever had**._

and we use _**never**_ for the [negative form](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/questions-and-negatives):

> _**Have** you **ever met** George?  
> Yes, but I**'ve never met** his wife._

* for something that **happened in the past** but is **important in the present**:

> _I can't get in the house. I**'ve lost** my keys.  
> Teresa isn't at home. I think she **has gone** shopping._

### _**have been**_ **and** _**have gone**_

We use _**have/has been**_ when someone has _**gone**_ to a place and _**returned**_:

> _A: Where **have** you **been**?  
> B: I**'ve** just **been** out **to** the supermarket._

> _A: **Have** you **ever been to** San Francisco?  
> B: No, but I**'ve been to** Los Angeles._

But when someone **has not returned**, we use _**have/has gone**_:

> _A: Where's Maria? I haven't seen her for weeks.  
> B: She**'s gone to** Paris for a week. She'll be back tomorrow._

### **Present perfect with time adverbials** 

We often use the present perfect with adverbials **which refer to the recent past**:

| _recently_ | _just_ | _only just_ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |


> _Scientists **have** **recently** **discovered** a new breed of monkey.  
> We **have** **just** **got** back from our holidays._

or **adverbials which include the present**:

| _so far     until now     up to now ever_ \(in questions\) _yet_ \(in questions and negatives\) |
| :--- |


> _**Have** you **ever** **seen** a ghost?  
> Where **have** you **been** **up to now**?  
> A: **Have** you **finished** your homework **yet**?  
> B: No, **so far** I**'ve** only **done** my history._

After a clause with the present perfect we often use **a clause with** _**since**_ **to show when something started in the past**:

> _I**'ve worked** here **since I left school**.  
> I**'ve been watching** that programme every week **since it started**._
