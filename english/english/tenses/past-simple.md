# Past Simple

The simple past \(also called past simple, past indefinite or preterite\) is a [verb tense](https://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/verbtenseintro.html) which is used to show that a completed action took place at a specific time in the past. The simple past is also frequently used to talk about past habits and generalizations. Read on for detailed descriptions, examples, and simple past exercises.

### Simple Past Forms

The simple past is formed using the **verb + ed**. In addition, there are many [verbs with irregular past forms](https://www.englishpage.com/irregularverbs/irregularverbs.html). Questions are made with _did_ and negative forms are made with _did not_.

* Statement: You **called** Debbie.
* Question: **Did** you **call** Debbie?
* Negative: You **did not call** Debbie.

### Simple Past Uses

#### USE 1 Completed Action in the Past

![simple past completed action](https://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepast.gif)

Use the simple past to express the idea that an action started and finished at a specific time in the past. Sometimes, the speaker may not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.

Examples:

* I **saw** a movie yesterday.
* I **didn't see** a play yesterday.
* Last year, I **traveled** to Japan.
* Last year, I **didn't travel** to Korea.
* **Did** you **have** dinner last night?
* She **washed** her car.
* He **didn't wash** his car.

#### USE 2 A Series of Completed Actions

![simple past series](https://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastseries.gif)

We use the simple past to list a series of completed actions in the past. These actions happen 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.

Examples:

* I **finished** work, **walked** to the beach, and **found** a nice place to swim.
* He **arrived** from the airport at 8:00, **checked** into the hotel at 9:00, and **met** the others at 10:00.
* **Did** you **add** flour, **pour** in the milk, and then **add** the eggs?

#### USE 3 Duration in the Past

![simple past duration](https://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastduration.gif)

The simple past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.

Examples:

* I **lived** in Brazil for two years.
* Shauna **studied** Japanese for five years.
* They **sat** at the beach all day.
* They **did not stay** at the party the entire time.
* We **talked** on the phone for thirty minutes.
* A: How long **did** you **wait** for them? B: We **waited** for one hour.

#### USE 4 Habits in the Past

![simple past habit](https://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepasthabit.gif)

The simple past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same meaning as "[used to](https://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/usedto.html)." To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child, when I was younger, etc.

Examples:

* I **studied** French when I was a child.
* He **played** the violin.
* He **didn't play** the piano.
* **Did** you **play** a musical instrument when you were a kid?
* She **worked** at the movie theater after school.
* They never **went** to school, they always **skipped** class.

#### USE 5 Past Facts or Generalizations

![simple past fact](https://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastfact.gif)

The simple past can also be used to describe past facts or generalizations which are no longer true. As in USE 4 above, this use of the simple past is quite similar to the expression "[used to](https://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/usedto.html)."

Examples:

* She **was** shy as a child, but now she is very outgoing.
* He **didn't like** tomatoes before.
* **Did** you **live** in Texas when you **were** a kid?
* People **paid** much more to make cell phone calls in the past.

### Simple Past Tips

#### IMPORTANT When-Clauses Happen First

Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when I dropped my pen..." or "when class began..." These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very important. The examples below contain when-clauses.

Examples:

* **When I paid her one dollar**, she answered my question.
* She answered my question **when I paid her one dollar**.

When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the simple past. Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered my question. It is not important whether "when I paid her one dollar" is at the beginning of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning. First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.

Example:

* I paid her one dollar **when she answered my question**.

#### ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You **just** called Debbie.
* Did you **just** call Debbie?

#### ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* Tom **repaired** the car. _Active_
* The car **was repaired** by Tom. _Passive_
