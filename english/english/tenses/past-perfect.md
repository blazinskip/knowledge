# Past Perfect



#### FUNCTIONS OF THE PAST PERFECT

The past perfect refers to a time **earlier than before now**. It is used to make it clear that **one event happened before another** in the past. It does not matter which event is mentioned first - the tense makes it clear which one happened first.

In these examples, Event A is the event that happened first and Event B is the second or more recent event:

| **Event A** | **Event B** |
| :--- | :--- |
| John **had gone** out | when I arrived in the office. |
| **Event A** | **Event B** |
| I **had saved** my document | before the computer crashed. |
| **Event B** | **Event A** |
| When they arrived | we **had already started** cooking. |
| **Event B** | **Event A** |
| He was very tired | because he **hadn't slept** well. |

#### FORMING THE PAST PERFECT

The Past Perfect tense in English is composed of two parts: the past tense of the verb _to have \(had\)_ + the past participle of the main verb.

| Subject | had | past participle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Affirmative** |  |  |
| She | had | given |
| **Negative** |  |  |
| She | hadn't | asked. |
| **Interrogative** |  |  |
| Had | they | arrived? |
| **Interrogative Negative** |  |  |
| Hadn't | you | finished? |

**TO DECIDE, PAST PERFECT**

| Affirmative | Negative | Interrogative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** had decided | I hadn't decided | Had I decided? |
| **You** had decided | You hadn't decided | Had you decided? |
| **She** had decided | She hadn't decided | Had she decided? |
| **We** had decided | We hadn't decided | Had we decided? |
| **They** had decided | They hadn't decided | Had they decided? |

#### PAST PERFECT + JUST

_'Just'_ is used with the past perfect to refer to an event that was only a short time earlier than before now, e.g.

* The train **had just left** when I arrived at the station.
* She **had just left** the room when the police arrived.
* I **had just put** the washing out when it started to rain.
