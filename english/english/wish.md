# Wish/If Only

### **Wishes**

We use the verb _**wish**_ or the phrase _**if only**_ to talk about things which we want but which are not possible:

> _**I wish** I could see you next week.  
> **If only** we could stop for a drink.  
> **I wish** we had a bigger house.  
> They are always busy. **If only** they had more time.  
> John was very lazy at school. Now **he wishes** he had worked harder._

We use _wish_ and _if only_ with [**past tense forms**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-tense):

* We use past tense [**modals**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/modal-verbs) ****_**would**_ and _**could**_ to talk about **wishes for the future**:

> _I don't like my work. **I wish I could** get a better job.  
> That's a dreadful noise. **I wish it would** stop.  
> I always have to get home early. **If only my parents would** let me stay out later._

* We use [**past simple**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-simple) and [**continuous**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-continuous) to talk about **wishes for the present**:

> _I don't like this place. **I wish I lived** somewhere more interesting.  
> These seats are very uncomfortable. **I wish we were travelling** first class.  
> **I wish I was** taller.  
> **John wishes he wasn't** so busy.  
> I'm freezing. **If only it wasn't** so cold._

* After _I/he/she/it_, we can use _**were**_ **instead of** _**was**_:

> _**I wish I was/were** taller.  
> **John wishes he wasn't/weren't** so busy.  
> I'm freezing. **If only it wasn't/weren't** so cold._

* We use the [**past perfect**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-perfect) to talk about **wishes for the past**:

> _**I wish I had worked** harder when I was at school.  
> **Mary wishes she had listened** to what her mother told her.  
> **I wish I hadnâ€™t spent** so much money last month._

### **Hypotheses \(things we imagine\)**

#### **Expressions**

When we are talking about hypotheses, we use expressions like:

| _what if ... ?_ | _in case_ | _suppose \(that\)_ | _supposing \(that\)_ | _imagine \(if/that\)_ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |


We use these expressions:

* with [**present tense forms**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/present-tense) to talk about the [**present**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/talking-about-present) or [**future**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/talking-about-future) if we think something is **likely** to be true or to happen:

> _We should phone them **in case they are** lost.  
> Those steps are dangerous. **Suppose someone has** an accident._

* with [**past tense forms**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-tense) to talk about the [**present**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/talking-about-present) ****or [**future**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/talking-about-future) to suggest something is **not likely** to be true or to happen:

> _**Imagine you won** the lottery. What would you do with the money?  
> **What if he lost** his job? What would happen then?_

* with the [**past perfect**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/past-perfect) ****to talk about things in the [**past**](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/talking-about-past) ****which **did not happen**:

> _**Suppose you hadn't passed** your exams. What would you have done?  
> **What if he had lost** his job? What would his wife have said?_

#### **Modal verbs**

We use [modals](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/modal-verbs) _**would** and **could**_ for a **hypothesis** about the **present or future**:

> _We can't all stay in a hotel. **It would be** very expensive.  
> Drive carefully or **you could have** an accident._

We use _**would**_ **in the main clause** and the **past tense in a subordinate clause** for a **hypothesis** about the **present or future**:

> _**I would** always **help** someone **who** really **needed** help.  
> **I would** always **help** someone **if they** really **needed** it._

We use **modals with** _**have**_ to talk about something that **did not happen** in the **past**:

> _I didn't see Mary, or I **might have spoken** to her.  
> It's a pity Jack wasn't at the party. **He would have enjoyed** it.  
> Why didn't you ask me? **I could have told** you the answer._

We use _**would have**_ **in the main clause** and the **past perfect in a subordinate clause** to talk about something that **did not happen** in the **past**:

> _**I would have helped** anyone **who had asked** me.  
> **I would have helped** you **if you had asked** me._
